## Overview

**AeroVisor 4T** is a civilian-focused platform for receiving, visualizing and analyzing UAV telemetry and sensor streams. Built for engineers, trainers and inspection teams, it provides layered map visualization, mission planning, secure local logging and exportable analytics — designed with privacy, safety and legal compliance in mind.

---

## Key Features

- 📡 Real-time telemetry viewer (GPS, altitude, speed, heading, battery states).  
- 🗺 Multi-layer maps with offline tile support and custom base maps.  
- 📈 Flight analytics: time series, parameter plots, mission comparison, CSV export.  
- 🔔 Alerting engine for configurable thresholds (local notifications only).  
- 🧭 Mission planner and simulator for operator training.  
- 🔒 Security: TLS channels, role-based access control, audit logs.  
- 💾 Local mission archive and report generation (PDF/CSV/KML).  
- 🔌 Integration endpoints for RTPS/UDP/TCP sources and common log formats.

---

## Advanced Capabilities

- 🛰 External sensor support (meteorological sensors, LiDAR summaries, simple video preview).  
- 🧪 Testbench mode for replaying logs and running pre-flight simulations.  
- 📚 Training mode with annotated missions and instructor notes.  
- ⚙️ Plugin API for custom visualizations and third-party connectors.  
- 🗄 Policy-driven data retention and anonymization tools.
